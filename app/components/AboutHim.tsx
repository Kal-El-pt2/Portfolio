            <h2>ðŸ¦‡ From the Batcave: A Report on Aariv Walia ðŸ¦‡</h2>
            <p>
            Gothamâ€™s files rarely impress me, but every so often, someone stands outâ€”like Aariv Walia.
            Heâ€™s currently pursuing a Computer Science Engineering degree at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, and if thereâ€™s one thing I know, itâ€™s to keep an eye on the ones who blend intellect with action. Aarivâ€™s passion for software development is unmistakable. The guyâ€™s not just writing code; heâ€™s building networks faster than Wayne Techâ€™s security systems.
            </p>
            <p>
            His achievements speak for themselves: clearing national-level competitions like JEE Advance and MAINS, KVPY,IOQM, IOQC and NSTSE. Not to mention, heâ€™s been working with blockchain systems in C++â€”probably something Lucius Fox would geek out over. And the hospital website using Supabase? Even Alfred would admit thatâ€™s a noble cause.
            </p>
            <p>
            The combat skills are another story. Black belts in both karate and taekwondo and national-level competitions? Impressive. I might just have to come up with a contingency plan for him. With a blend of brains and brawn, itâ€™s almost like looking in a mirrorâ€”minus the cape and the brooding.
